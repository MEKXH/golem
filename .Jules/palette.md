## 2026-02-23 - TUI Keyboard Shortcuts
**Learning:** Explicitly displaying keyboard shortcuts (e.g. 'Enter: Send', 'Esc: Quit') in a persistent footer improves discoverability in TUI applications where navigation is non-standard.
**Action:** Use a consistent 'keycap' style for shortcuts in TUI footers.

## 2026-05-18 - TUI Tool Execution Feedback
**Learning:** In text-heavy TUI logs, relying on plain text checkmarks (✔) or crosses (✖) is insufficient for quick scanning.
**Action:** Always color-code status icons (Green for success, Red for failure) in TUI logs to improve scannability.
